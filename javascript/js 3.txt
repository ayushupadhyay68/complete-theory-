	control strcutures / control flow statements / flow control statements -: are used to control the execution of the program.
	
	
		i. conditional statements -: are used to execute the code according to a specific condition.
		
			a. if statement - is used to test a particular condition and executes the code if the condition evaluates to true.
			
				syntax -:
				
					if(condition){
						
						your code to be written here
					
					}
					
					
			b. else if statement - is used to test a particulat condition if the condition of if statement is false then executes the code if the condition evaluates to true.
			
			
				syntax -:
				
					if(condition){
					
						your code to be written here
					
					}
					else if(condition){
						
						your code to be written here
					
					}
					.
					..
					...
					
			c. else statment  - is used to execute the code when there is no condition matches true of niether if statement nor else if statement.
			
				syntax 1 -:
				
					if(condition){
					
						your code to be written here
					
					}
					
					else{
						
						your code to be written here
					
					}
					
				syntax 2 -:
				
					if(condition){
						
						your code here
						
					}
					else if(condition){
						
						your code here
						
					}
					.
					..
					else{
						
						your code here
					
					}
	
			
			d. switch...case statement - is used to execute / test the particular condition /variable against several posssible values.
			
				syntax -:
				
					switch(condition/variable){
						
						case value:
						your code to be written here
						break;
						
						case value:
						your code to be written here
						break;
						
						.
						..
						...
						
						default:
						your code to be written here
						
					
					}
					
		
		ii. looping statements - are used to execute the code again and again depends upon the condition.
		
			a. for loop - it is the most basic programming construct loop is used to execute the code repeatadly while condition is true.
			
				syntax -:
				
					for(initilization;condition;increment/decrement){
					
						your code to be written here
						
					}
					
					
			b. while loop - is used to loop / repeat / execute the code again & again until the condition becomes false;
			
				syntax -:
				
					while(condition){
					
						your code to be written here
					
					}
			
			
			c. do...while loop - it works same as while but it executes the code atleast once event if the condition is false.
			
				syntax -:
				
					do{
					
						your code to be written here
					
					}
					while(condition)
					
					
		iii.  break / continue statements -:
		
			break statement - is used to terminate the statement and loop.
			
				syntax -:
				
					break;
					
					
			
			continue statement - is used to skip the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
			
				syntax -:
				
					continue;
