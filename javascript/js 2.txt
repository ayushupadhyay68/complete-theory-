		types of operators -:
		
			i. arithmetic operators -:
			
			
				+				addition
				
				-				subtraction
				
				*				multiplication
				
				/				division
				
				%				modulus (returns the remainder value after dividing the first number with the second)
		
		
			ii. assignment operators -: 
			
				=				assignment
				
				+=				addition assignment
				
				-=				subtraction assignment
				
				*=				multiplication assignment
				
				/=				division assignment
				
				%=				modulus assignment
				
				
			var a = 10;
			
			a += 40; // value will be 50 of a
			
			a = a + 40;
		
		
			iii. comparision operators -: are used to compare two values and returns the true or false based on the expression.
			
			
				<				less than
				
				>				greater than
				
				<=				less than or equal to
				
				>=				greater than or equal to
				
				==				equal to
				
				===				identical equal to (value and type must be same for true output)
				
				!=				not equal to
				
				!==				not identical to
			
				
			
			iv. logical operators -: are used to work with logics / creates more logics.
			
				
				&&				and
				
				||				or
				
				!				not
				
				
			Truth Table for && (and) -:
			
			
			A			B			Output
			
			
			true		true		true
			
			true		false		false
			
			false 		false		false
			
			false		true		false
			
			
			
			Truth Table for || (or) -:
			
			
			A			B			Output
			
			
			true		true		true
			
			true		false		true
			
			false 		false		false
			
			false		true		true
			
		
		v. concatenation operators -: are used to combine two or more string.
		
			
			+			concatenation / concat

			
			+=			concatenation assignment
		
		
		
		vi. unary / increment and decrement operators -: are used to add or less one from the variable / value.

			
			++			increment
			
			--			decrement
			
			
			note -: increment and decrement can be done in two ways.
			
			i. pre increment / decrement - in this case value add / less first and then assigned to the variable.
			
				e.g. -:
				
					var a = 10;
					
					++a; // 11
					
					a // 11
					
					
			
			ii. post increment / decrement - in this case value assigned first and add / less after the assignment.
			
				e.g. -:
				
					var a = 10;
					
					a++; // 10
					
					a // 11
					
		vii. conditional / ternary operator -: is used to pass the value in a variable according to the particular condition.
		
			syntax -:
			
				(condition)? code for true : code for false;
